    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

In particular, studies have shown that factors such as negative sentiments is a key factor that influences the level of retweets received by MPs. These findings suggest that analyzing the words and language used by MPs in their tweets can provide insights into their strategies for gaining popularity on social media platforms.\n",

By examining the use of specific words and phrases across tweets from different political parties, it is possible to score a tweet from a MP given their party, by template matching language patterns from that party and model how they will be reacted upon by the public.\n",

However, some statements fail to gain traction and leave their originators looking out of touch with their constituents and the political atmosphere. \n",

By training a model with sentiment analysis of Tweets, word frequency analysis, partisan affiliation, and engagement metrics, we believe that we will be able to accurately predict the extent of engagement a potential Tweet will have. \n"

Other features could include the partisan affiliation of the member of Congress who tweeted the message, the number of followers they have, and the time of day the tweet was posted.\n",

    "To implement this solution, one could use a variety of libraries and functions. For example, the NLTK library could be used for sentiment analysis, while scikit-learn could be used for machine learning.\n",

It may also be helpful to compare the performance of the model against a benchmark model, such as a simple baseline that predicts the most common class (e.g. non-viral).\n",

The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution.

In the context of predicting tweet engagement, precision represents the proportion of predicted viral tweets that are actually viral, while recall represents the proportion of actual viral tweets that are correctly predicted as viral. The F1 score balances these two metrics, giving equal weight to precision and recall, and provides a single score that summarizes the overall performance of the model.\n",

    "For example, if the solution model correctly predicts 80% of viral tweets with a precision of 75%, and correctly predicts 70% of non-viral tweets with a precision of 90%, then the F1 score would be:\n",
