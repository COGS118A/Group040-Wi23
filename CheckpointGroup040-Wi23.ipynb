    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem Statement\n",
    "Twitter has become a popular platform for political discourse, where people express their views on a variety of issues. Given the increasing polarization in the political landscape, it is of great interest to understand how people's political views are reflected in their online behavior. In this project, we propose to investigate whether it is possible to accurately classify Twitter users' political affiliation based on their tweets using a supervised learning approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dataset\n",
    "We will collect data from Twitter using the Webscraping. We will primarily gather tweets from verified accounts from democratic and republican members of congress. We are aware this restriction could bias the data. If we were to work with a subset of random Twitter users instead, it would be difficult to manually identify hundreds of Twitter accounts whether they belong to an American political party, or show liberal or conservative viewpoints. Additionally, filtering through bot accounts pose another difficult challenge. \n",
    "Gathering data from verified Twitter accounts of members of congress allows us to easily identify political leanings as well as ensuring that the Tweets come from real individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Preprocessing\n",
    "We will preprocess the collected data to extract features that are relevant for the classification task. This will include removing stop words, stemming, and tokenizing the text. We will also engineer additonal features such as key word frequency and sentiment analysis predictions to capture additional information that may be relevant for the classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Development \n",
    "!!! TO BE UPDATED !!!\n",
    "We will compare the performance of different algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, to determine which algorithm is best suited for the task. We will also explore the use of ensemble methods, such as random forests and gradient boosting, to improve the accuracy of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Evaluation\n",
    "!!! TO BE UPDATED !!!\n",
    "We will evaluate the performance of our model using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will also use techniques such as cross-validation to ensure that our model is not overfitting the training data. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "!!! OLD BACKGROUND, NEED CITATIONS !!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has demonstrated that sentiment analysis of Members of Parliament (MPs) s' tweets can be used to predict their popularity. In particular, studies have shown that factors such as negative sentiments is a key factor that influences the level of retweets received by MPs <a name=\"lorenz\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lorenznote). These findings suggest that analyzing the words and language used by MPs in their tweets can provide insights into their strategies for gaining popularity on social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our real-world political knowledge, we suspect that the use of certain words and language patterns may have different impacts on the popularity of tweets from MPs of different parties. To explore this further, we are interested in investigating whether the distribution of language use and popularity among different parties can be modeled using a mixture of supervised and unsupervised methods. By examining the use of specific words and phrases across tweets from different political parties, it is possible to score a tweet from a MP given their party, by template matching language patterns from that party and model how they will be reacted upon by the public <a name=\"admonish\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#admonishnote)."
